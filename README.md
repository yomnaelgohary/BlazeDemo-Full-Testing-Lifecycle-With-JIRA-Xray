# Demo Blaze E-commerce Platform  
## Comprehensive Testing and Requirements Management

---

### Project Overview

This project covers a comprehensive testing and requirements management process applied to the Demo Blaze E-commerce platform. The process follows ISTQB best practices, ensuring high quality through detailed requirements analysis, test design, execution, defect management, usability evaluation, release readiness, and regression strategy planning.

### What I Did

1. **Requirements Analysis & User Story Creation**  
   - Created detailed user stories in Excel with clear acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then and checklist formats).  
   - Ensured clarity and testability of requirements.

2. **Ambiguity and Risk Identification**  
   - Analyzed user stories to identify ambiguities, contradictions, and non-testable elements.  
   - Documented 10 issues with suggestions for improvement.

3. **Test Scenario and Test Case Development**  
   - Developed 3 test scenarios covering main functionalities.  
   - Wrote 4 test cases addressing functional behavior, edge cases, and failure conditions.

4. **Manual Functional Testing Execution**  
   - Executed test cases on key features (login, product purchase, cart management).  
   - Logged pass/fail results and defects.  
   - Suggested additional test scenarios for improved coverage.

5. **Usability Testing**  
   - Assessed navigation, clarity, and accessibility.  
   - Identified 3 usability issues with severity ratings and improvement suggestions.

6. **Release Reporting**  
   - Summarized testing outcomes, defect status, and risks.  
   - Provided readiness assessment for deployment.

7. **Regression Testing Strategy**  
   - Analyzed impact of new product filters feature.  
   - Identified 3 affected areas and defined 5 regression test cases.  
   - Selected 2 test cases suitable for automation, with justifications.

8. **Migration to JIRA and Xray**  
   - Migrated user stories, test cases, and defect logs from Excel to JIRA and Xray.  
   - Maintained traceability links between artifacts.  
   - Validated migration with traceability reports and screenshots.
